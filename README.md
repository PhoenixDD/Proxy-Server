# Proxy-Server

Description:
A proxy server created in C, handles HTTP and FTP Protocols.
The code is properly documented for reference.

Issues:
It is definitly not efficient or elegant, it has just been one of the projects I tried and have manged to pull off :)
It might run into broken pipe errors at certain ocasions.
